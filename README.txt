Rule of game:
1. The player must guess the secret number between 1 and 20!
2. The player can type the number in input and check it. The program can show us the helper message "Too low" or "Too high";
3. The player has the 20 score at the start of game and after each guess it decrease by 1;
4. Also there is a "High Score", which show the best result of guessed number after finish the game;
5. And the game has a "Again" button, which can restart the game.
